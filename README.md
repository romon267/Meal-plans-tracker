# Meal-plans-tracker
This is a website made with python, django and a bit of javascript. It is a web app for planning your meals and tracking calories. It makes planning very easy by sorting your meal by days and meal times (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snacks). Plans automatically count calories and estimated price for buying products for recipes. Structure of this app is like: Products -> Recipes -> Plans. Only admins can make products currently, but recipes can be made by all users. Users can compose their own recipes from products, or save recipes made by other users and admins. Then users can make their own plans (3 or 7 days) out of recipes they made/saved. The code posted here is not the final version of my web app, I pushed it further with adding more features and ux/ui. Also it has localization for russian language. Currently it's running on heroku at http://mealtracking.herokuapp.com.
